# RLMiningGame

This will become my RL (Roguelike) Game.
Programmed in Python with libtcod.
Based on the http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2"-Tutorial from TStand90!

Every Commit ist one Part until i Finish the Tutorial. After the Tutorial i want to expand the Game and build a Space Mining Game. You are flying with your ship to the next Asteroid and start mining it. You should upgarde your Euqipment to mine better Rocks and make more Credits. Maybe you will find Secrets, like destroyed Ships or Alien Artifacts. But this is Content for the Future. First letÂ´s build an awesome RL-Base!

All credits goes to TStand90 for his awesome Tutorial and Website.

This is the Way...
